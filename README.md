## Responsive Design

The website was designed with both mobile and desktop users in mind. In a day and age where more than half of the global
pageviews are rendered on a mobile device, responsive design is a very important aspect of a successful website.
The desktop website was designed with a horizontal minimalistic design in mind, the mobile website keeps the same
minimalistic design but vertically to adjust for the portrait viewport that most mobile users view websites in.

## Expansions

### Watched movies and watchlist

The user should be able to create an account, login to said account and mark movies as viewed or add them to a watchlist.

### Movie ratings

The user should be able to assign ratings to movies.
